### how to retrieve the logs in Test Suite Collection

A Test Suite Collection consists of multiple Test Suites. Once you execute it, you will want to view all the logs emitted by test suites. However Katalon Studio GUI is a bit blunt and you are likely to wonder how you can view the logs.

There is an *eye icon* in the Test Suite Collection pane. See the following screenshot. By clicking the eye icon you will find a list of test suite logs where you can choose one to retrieve.
